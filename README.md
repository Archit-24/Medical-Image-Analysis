## Features

- **Medical Image Analysis**: Analyzes medical images to extract features and make predictions.
- **Supervised Learning**: Utilizes a supervised learning approach with ground truth labels for training.
- **Model Training**: Trains machine learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other classifiers using the provided dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Google Colab Integration**: Designed to run on Google Colab for easy access to computational resources and collaboration.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes medical images, model predictions, and evaluation metrics for better understanding and interpretation.
- **Documentation**: Provides clear documentation and comments to facilitate understanding and future development.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `numpy`, `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks
  - `tensorflow`, `keras` for deep learning models
- **Google Colab**: Utilizes Google Colab notebooks for running the project in a cloud-based environment.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Uses Jupyter notebooks for interactive development and documentation.

## Installation

As this project is designed to run on Google Colab, there is no traditional installation process. However, you can follow these steps to get started:

1. Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) in your web browser.
2. Upload the project notebooks and dataset to your Google Drive or directly to Colab.
3. Open the main notebook and run each cell sequentially to execute the project.

## Usage

1. Open the main notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions and execute each cell to load the dataset, preprocess images, train models, and evaluate performance.
3. Visualize the results and interpret the model predictions.
4. Modify the notebook as needed for experimentation and further analysis.
